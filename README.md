# Face-Verification-and-Recognition-using-DeepFace
DeepFace is a powerful Python library that simplifies the implementation of state-of-the-art facial recognition models. In this process, two primary tasks are performed: face verification and face recognition.

Face Verification checks whether two images belong to the same person. It compares two faces and returns a similarity score to determine if they match.

Face Recognition identifies a person by comparing a given image against a database of known faces to find the best match. It provides the option to filter the results based on a similarity threshold.

By leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG-Face, ArcFace, and Facenet, DeepFace makes these processes straightforward while providing high accuracy.

Detailed Steps:
1. Install Dependencies:
Before starting, you need to install the necessary libraries. This involves installing DeepFace via pip and cloning the repository from GitHub. Then, you set up the environment to enable the use of DeepFace within the current workspace.

2. Import Required Libraries:
Once the dependencies are installed, the necessary libraries for face recognition and verification are imported. These include the DeepFace library itself for the recognition tasks, and tools such as PIL for handling images and IPython.display to display images directly within the notebook interface.

3. Face Verification:
The first major task is face verification. In this step, you provide two images, and the system checks if they represent the same person. DeepFace computes the similarity between the two images, and the result will tell you whether they are likely to be the same person or not. The verification process outputs a similarity score that determines the match.

4. Verification Result Interpretation:
After verification, the result will be checked. If the similarity score is above a defined threshold, the system will indicate that the faces are similar (i.e., from the same person). If the score is below the threshold, the system will indicate that the faces are not similar.

5. Face Recognition:
The next task is face recognition. This involves comparing the input image against a database of known faces to find a match. DeepFace searches through a set of images stored in a predefined database folder and calculates the similarity score for each image. The system returns a list of the best-matching faces based on the database.

6. Define Similarity Threshold:
A similarity threshold is used to filter out weak matches. This threshold helps control how close the match must be for it to be considered a valid recognition. For example, values between 0.4 and 0.6 are commonly used, with lower values indicating a stricter match requirement.

7. Display Recognized Faces:
After performing recognition, if any faces in the database match the input image, the system will display those recognized images. This helps in visual confirmation of which known faces match the input image.

8. Display Non-recognized Image:
Regardless of whether a match is found or not, the input image is always displayed at the end for visual verification. This provides a reference to compare the non-recognized image against the results.

Summary:
The process involves verifying and recognizing faces using DeepFace. Verification determines if two images represent the same person, while recognition identifies a person by comparing the input image to a known database of faces. A similarity threshold helps filter the matches to ensure more accurate recognition results.
